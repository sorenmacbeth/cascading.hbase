Welcome

 This is the Cascading.HBase module.

 It provides support for reading/writing data to/from an HBase
 cluster when bound to a Cascading data processing flow.

 Cascading is a feature rich API for defining and executing complex,
 scale-free, and fault tolerant data processing workflows on a Hadoop
 cluster. It can be found at the following location:

   http://www.cascading.org/

 HBase is the Hadoop database. Its an open-source, distributed,
 column-oriented store modeled after the Google paper on Bigtable.

History

 This version has roots from the original Cascading.HBase effort by Chris Wensel, and then modified by Kurt Harriger to add the dynamic scheme, putting tuple fields into HBase columns, and vice versa.  Twitter's Maple project also has roots from the original Cascading.HBase project, but is an update to Cascading 2.0.  Maple lacks the dynamic scheme, so this project basically combines everything before it and updates to Cascading 2.0.x and HBase 0.94.x.

Building

 This version could be built by using apache maven:
 mvn package

If the tests are failing on your machine, do a `umask 022` before running maven.

Using

  The cascading-hbase.jar file should be added to the "lib"
  directory of your Hadoop application jar file along with all
  Cascading dependencies.

  See the TestHBaseDynamic and TestHBaseStatic unit tests for sample code on using the HBase taps,
  schemes and helpers in your Cascading application.
